# Pulse

This application animates any public feature service (or service with token) with the new WebGL Renderer in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. 

## Setlist.FM Pulse

This is a client application that uses a node.js middleware to get to the Setlist.FM API. The middleware can be run locally, but there is also a demo installation on [heroku](https://setlist-fm-connector.herokuapp.com/).

## Original application

The Setlist.FM capability was built on top of a fork from the orinal application you can read about on the [geonet blog](https://community.esri.com/people/smcgeeesriuk-esridist/blog/2018/06/29/feature-layer-animations-with-webgl).
